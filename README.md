### Project overview

Speaker recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a speaker based on their voice. It is commonly used for security and authentication purposes, such as access control to secure buildings or computer systems. The main challenges in speaker recognition include variability in the speech signal due to factors such as speaking style, background noise, and microphone quality, as well as the need for large amounts of training data to accurately model an individual's speech patterns. Additionally, speaker recognition systems must be able to adapt to changes in a person's voice over time, such as due to aging or changes in health.

In our project, we implemented a resnet-18 based nural network that trained on the VoxCeleb1 dataset. In order to adapt the audio files to fit the network we preformed the following augmentations:

* Every audiofile was clipped or padded into the same length 
* A STFT was then applied to the waveform 
* The resulting spectogram was then resized to fit the resnet model expected size (224,224)
* The spectogram was the concatunated on itself to create a (3,224,224) Tenzor
* The Tenzor is fed into the Resnet-18 model

In addition in order to improve the models results we preformed additional preprocessing on the data and changed the resnet-18 model, we will go over the changes and thair effect in the Training and testing different augmetations section of this file. 


### The Dataset

In our project we used the VoxCeleb1 dataset.
VoxCeleb1 is a dataset of speech snippets used for training and evaluating speaker recognition systems. It was created by researchers at the University of Oxford and consists of over 100,000 clips of audio from over 1,251 celebrities. The dataset includes a diverse set of speakers with different accents, ages, and genders, and includes both studio and telephone-quality recordings. The dataset is widely used in the research community for training and evaluating speaker recognition systems, and has been used to train state-of-the-art models. It was the first large-scale public dataset for speaker recognition and has been followed by VoxCeleb2 and VoxCeleb1-E.

Due to computational and memory restrictions, our model was trained on the first 200 speakers (id = 1 to id = 200) but will work on a larger section of the dataset. 

### Training and testing different augmetations
Firstly, in order to create a good baseline for our project, we tested two different normalization methods. The first being min-max scaling and the second normalizing by the frequency bins. It is important to note, that normalization is critical for the model to work properly since Resnet-18 expects a normalized input. We obtained the following

As seen above, both normalizations get an 100% accuracy on the train set, but have a large deficiency in the validation set. The frequency bins normalization got an accuracy score that is 15% higher than the min-max scaling normalization. Therefore, we chose it for our baseline to be the network.

### Models results
To examine the effect of Contrastive-center loss regularization, we ran the following experiments in addition to the baseline: 
* Contrastive-center loss regularization with Adagrad optimizer with lr=0.001 and ùúÜ=1
* Contrastive-center loss regularization with Adam optimizer with lr=0.002 and ùúÜ=0.55

As seen below, the regularization did not effect the train loss.

In addition, in all cases on our validation set, we converge relatively to the same value but in a different pace.

Note that the value of the Contrastive-center loss is small from the first iteration - approximal $2\cdot10^(-4)$ as opposed to the Cross-Entropy loss that starts at the value of about 4. Due to the extreme size difference between the CCL regularization and the Cross Entropy loss, the CCL regularization has a minor impact on the train and validation coverage as seen inthe graphs above.

| Model | Top-1 (%) | Top-5 (%) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Baseline | **79.09** | 92.78 |
| Contrastive-center loss with Adagrad | 78.98 | **93.24** |
| Contrastive-center loss with Adam | 78.52 | 92.82 |

As seen in the table above, all 3 experiments obtain similar top-1 accuracy, whereas the Contrastive-center loss experiment with Adagrad optimizer increased the top-5 accuracy by 0.5%, showing that the regularization improved the generalization of the model.
